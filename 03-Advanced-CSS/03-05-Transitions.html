    ****************************************************************************************************
    The transition-duration (MAD) - CSS property sets the length of time a transition animation should take to complete. 
    By default, the value is 0s, meaning that no animation will occur.
    ****************************************************************************************************
    You may specify multiple durations; each duration will be applied to the corresponding property as specified by 
    the transition-property property, which acts as a master list.
    If there are fewer durations specified than in the master list, the user agent repeat the list of durations. 
    If there are more durations, the list is truncated to the right size. In both case the CSS declaration stays valid.






    ****************************************************************************************************
    transition-delay - The transition-delay CSS property specifies the duration to wait before starting a property's transition effect when its value changes.
    The delay may be zero, positive, or negative:

    A value of 0s (or 0ms) will begin the transition effect immediately.
    A positive value will delay the start of the transition effect for the given length of time.
    A negative value will begin the transition effect immediately, and partway through the effect. `
    In other words, the effect will be animated as if it had already been running for the given length of time.
    You may specify multiple delays, which is useful when transitioning multiple properties. 
    Each delay will be applied to the corresponding property as specified by the transition-property property,
    which acts as a master list. If there are fewer delays specified than in the master list,
    the list of delay values will be repeated until there are enough. If there are more delays,
    the list of delay values will be truncated to match the number of properties. In both cases, the CSS declaration remains valid.

    transition-time-function - The transition-timing-function CSS property sets how intermediate values 
    are calculated for CSS properties being affected by a transition effect
    ****************************************************************************************************

    Each <easing-function> represents the easing function to link to the corresponding property to transition,
    as defined in transition-property. The non-step keyword values (ease, linear, ease-in-out, etc.) each represent
    cubic BÃ©zier curve with fixed four point values, with the cubic-bezier() function value allowing for a non-predefined value.
    The step timing functions divides the input time into a specified number of intervals that are equal in length.
    It is defined by a number of steps and a step position.
